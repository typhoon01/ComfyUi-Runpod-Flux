## Deployment

To deploy this project run my template in Runpod, <br />
you can search for it with "DJZ" and find it in the list. <br />
Assign a GPU & your Network Storage, then start it up. <br />
Some pods take a long time to install everything, <br />
this is normal, so keep an eye on the logs.<br />
<br />
enter these credentials when you go to launch the web interface.<br />
```
  user = user, password = password
```

# DJZ-init (ComfyUI) <br />
<br /><br />
I will provide initialisation scripts if needed for various tasks in this repo. <br />

Above is the first work in progress script, which adds Flux Dev support, my Flux Lora's, the DJZ-Nodes pack & some custom nodes required to run my workflows. <br />
Workflows should also be added when this project is finished. Use the Raw link in the env var's:
